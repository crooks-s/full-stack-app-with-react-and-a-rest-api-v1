# Full Stack Application - School Courses and Users

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation / Set-up Instructions

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm i`  or  `npm install`  to install dependencies
This must be done in both ```api/``` and ```client/``` unfortunately.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Again, this needs to be done in both ```api/``` and ```client/```. \
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in your browser. \
The server will be hosted on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). 


## Introduction
This is a full-stack application for a school database in which courses can viewed by anyone; courses can be created by users, and modified or deleted by their owners. The front-end was built with ```create-react-app``` as noted above. The back-end was built with Express.js and SQL which was created from Unit 9 of the Team Treehouse FullStack JavaScript Techdegree. You may see the original API [here](https://github.com/crooks-s/rest-api-sql-v3) which is project 9 in the Team Treehouse FullStack JavaScript Techdegree program. I did modify some of the API for validation and clarification, but the logic is the same. Consideration to improve UI/UX will be listed in Issues.

## Contributions
Team treehouse supplied mockups and markup examples for reference, the project guidelines, and the styling via global.css.
