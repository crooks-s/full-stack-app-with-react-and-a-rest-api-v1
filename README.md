# Full Stack Application - School Courses and Users
## Introduction
Treehouse Unit 10 Project. This is a full-stack application for a school database in which courses can viewed by anyone; courses can be created by users, and modified or deleted by their owners.
<br /> **Note**: You may see the original API [here](https://github.com/crooks-s/rest-api-sql-v3) which is project 9 in the Team Treehouse FullStack JavaScript Techdegree program. I did modify some of the API for validation and clarification, but the logic is the same.

## Tech Stack
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
<br />Front-end: HTML/CSS. JavaScript. React.
<br />Back-end: Express.js, Node.js, SQL.

## Running the Project
Clone the project.
<br />In the project directory, you can run:
<br /> ```npm i```  or  ```npm install```  to install dependencies
<br />--The above step must be done in both ```api/``` and ```client/``` unfortunately.--
<br /> Open the ```client/``` directory.
<br /> In terminal, run ```npm start```
<br /> The client side will be hosted on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
<br /> The server side will be hosted on [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)
<br /> I have a live version [here](https://fullstackapp.up.railway.app/).
